# DHL_HelpDesk_Chatbot
An assistive chatbot for DHL customers

ChatBot (Artificial Intelligence)

How to run our Chatbot:- 

We have programmed our chatbot to achieve two functionality. One is to track the package and another one to fasten and delay the delivery time.
In order to track the package you can simply ask the bot to give the details of the parcel by asking like “track my package”,”where is my parcel”,”find the parcel with tracking is as12345” etc. If a tracking Id is given bot will automatically extract the id from the converstation and display the result or it will ask for one in order to pull information. Tracking Id is configured to be any combination of letters and number in a word.
If the customer wishes to fasten or delay the process it can chat with conversation like “delay my parcel by 3 days”, ” could you make it arrive faster by 2 days”, etc.. and the chatbot will take their request and display the response accordingly.
